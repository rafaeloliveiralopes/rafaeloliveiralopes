# Hello, I'm Rafael Lopes!

My first contact with web development was in 2018, using WordPress to write a blog about music studies. At that time, I was amazed and kept wondering how WordPress templates and web pages were developed entirely from scratch.

In December 2021, I decided to dedicate myself 100% to my career transition to become a full-stack developer, and Iâ€™m happy with my decision because I love learning and developing new skills. Watching each project take shape is sensational. It feels like having superpowers! ðŸ’ª

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and expanding my knowledge in AI and Machine Learning.

Welcome to my GitHub and feel free to get in touch through social media or email if you'd like!

### Some Facts and Fun Things About Me

* I'm Rodolphoâ€™s dad
* I can read sheet music and play the acoustic guitar.
* In my free time, when Iâ€™m not studying, I love playing games and watching series with my wife.
